			"abstract": "A long term co-design project with KidsTeam UW to create a remote and hybrid tangible co-design tool. We utilize Sony toio robots to build a networked robot platform that child designers and their adult design partners can use to collaborate in real time. Through this project, we gain insights about tangible co-design tools for remote and hybrid contexts.",
			"description": ["In Human-Computer Interaction, children have been active participants in co-designing future technologies for other children. Most studies in co-design (prior to COVID-19), focused on co-located in-person sessions that involved physical techniques, such as hand-drawn and crafted prototypes, acting out scenarios, and playing movement games to generate ideas. However, these physically proximal activities are not possible online. This lack of physical engagement creates barriers and leaves children feeling less creative and engaged in the remote co-design process.", "To workaround this situation in which children are co-designing online, we have worked with KidsTeam UW to create another option for remote co-design: tangible interfaces for remote co-design. Our project, Together Apart, uses toio tabletop robots and a tablet interface to add a tangible dimension to online co-design. When using our system, our child design partners acted in an engaged manner not typically seen in remote settings.", "While working together online, KidsTeam UW children used our toio robotics system to design games, swarm robot expressions, and create physical art together. For our workshop contribution, we will showcase some of our work-in-progress and develop potential collaborations for tangible online co-design. In the future we plan to move from a fully remote environment to a hybrid environment for co-design. We will engage in conversations with KidsTeam UW about how tangible interfaces for hybrid environments differ from fully online contexts."],

			"subtitle": "Evaluating Sensory Extensions as input for an Interactive Math Simulation (Ratio and Proprotion)",
			"collaborators": ["Chris Hill", "Sammie Crowder", "Brett Fielder", "Emily Moore", "Ann Eisenberg"],
			"abstract": "Sensory extensions enhance our awareness by transforming variations in stimuli normally undetectable by human senses into perceivable outputs. Similarly, interactive simulations for learning promote an understanding of abstract phenomena. Combining sensory extension devices with interactive simulations gives users the novel opportunity to connect their sensory experiences in the physical world to computer-simulated concepts. We explore this opportunity by designing a suite of wearable sensory extension devices that interface with a uniquely inclusive PhET Simulation, Ratio and Proportion. In this simulation, two hands can be moved on-screen to various values, representing different mathematical ratios. Users explore changing hand heights to find and maintain ratios through visual and auditory feedback. Our sensory extension devices translate force, distance, sound frequency, and magnetic field strength to quantitative values in order to control individual hands in the computer simulation. This paper describes the design of the devices and our analysis of feedback from 23 high-school aged youth who used our designs to interact with the Ratio and Proportion.",

			"description": ["As virtual assistants and remote classes become increasingly common in fitness, so too does the need to reliably recognize human posture and activity. We build a system that explores how device-free Ultra-High Frequency Radio Frequency Identification (UHF RFID) enables low-cost fitness tracking without the trade-offs of worn sensors or cameras.", "Because UHF RFID systems are subject to signal shielding by the human body, it is possible to utilize returned signal strength from passive tags to infer user position. However, because previous implementations only support low resolution activity recognition, application of this technology to fitness tracking is limited. With deep learning and a constrained the sensing area, we demonstrate increased fidelity, in spite of our focus on off-the-shelf systems (which provide fewer readings per second)."],

				"description": ["We are inspired by related work in ambient displays as a promising technology for community wellness interfaces. Ambient displays are particularly applicable to community wellness, since they are well-suited for enabling continuous, background awareness of general states of large systems. There have been several works which use ambient displays to support mental wellness and stress management. For example, MoodLight is an interactive ambient lighting system that responds to epidermal activity biosensor data related to the user’s stress level. ", "With Cyber Garden, we design an ambient display for graduate students to report personal stress through biometrics and self-reported data. We use this data to create an anonymized, interactive visualization. We leverage previous workshops conducted with graduate students to ground our approach. When asked about burnout, these graduate students shared a desire to reach out for help, but reported not having a clear mechanism to do so. Additionally, these students reported that they would feel less alone in their difficult emotions if there was a way to see the challenging states of others."],

Using a top down camera and object recognition algorithm, the position and smell of an item placed on a tabletop can be simulated in a remote space. With Scent Bots design a mechanism to bring scent to a swarm robotics context while also exploring the nature of spatial scent for ambient telepresence.",

Our advisor works from New York City and our collaborators are stationed around the world, while our lab is based out of CU Boulder. After living in this unique situation for several months, we identified a desire in the team for ambient presence of remote collaborators. With Scent Bots, we explore the combination of location and scent for remote communication and presence.", "The system pairs video calling, object recognition, a top-down projector, and robots to connect two tabletops through scent. Each table is captured via a top-down webcam, which is projected on the remote partner's table. An object placed on one table triggers the remote Scent Bot. This robot will move to the position where the item, say a fresh cup of coffee, is located on the remote table and release a corresponding scent at that position."],

The resulting platform can be used for tangible play, communication, and co-creation.", "In contrast to previous approaches that use computer vision and fixed cameras for object recognition combined with a modified table, the toios in DOT recognize objects using markers placed on the base of the object, then move them. Because DOT uses a palm-sized assembly for both object recognition and movement, it does not require a stationary setup for object recognition."],

VTTV is designed to enable those without embedded systems skills to fabricate a TDU, controller, and craft tactile experiences easily. The project also includes a controller to program haptic patterns directly to the VTTV system.", "TDUs typically use electrotactile stimulation to display information to the user. These systems produce sensations by generating voltage pulses from electrodes to the user’s tongue. Commercial TDU systems are closed source, prohibitively expensive, and compromise haptic resolution for user comfort. We propose an alternative to electrotactile TDUs, a novel system that uses ERM motors for actuation. Our goal is to enable anyone to fabricate their own TDU using easily accessible materials with affordable off-the-shelf tools."],

We demonstrate this platform by building a melodica, keyboard, cello, trombone, and percussion. The system utilizes the capacitive touch breakout to create a 12 tone scale. From there, we utilize up to six buttons to modify the sound. In the case of the melodica and keyboard, the buttons can be used to change octaves. In the case of the cello, the buttons function as strings. The wind instruments utilize a microphone in the mouthpiece to detect whether and how hard air is being blown into the instrument."],
